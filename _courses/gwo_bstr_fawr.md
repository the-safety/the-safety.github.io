The aim of this course is to give the delegates the basic knowledge and skills through theoretical and practical training.

Delegates should be able to prevent fires, make appropriate judgements when evaluating a fire, manage evacuation of personnel and ensure all are safely accounted for in the event of an unmanageable fire. If the incident is judged to be safe, the delegates should be able to efficiently extinguish an initial fire by using basic hand held firefighting equipment.
